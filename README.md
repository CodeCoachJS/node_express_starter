You'll see many comments throughout the codebase which highlight common patterns and libraries.

There are 4 routes you can reach from your localhost like so:

[GET] `http://localhost:5000/user`

[POST] `http://localhost:5000/user`

[PUT] `http://localhost:5000/user`

[DELETE] `http://localhost:5000/user`

---

## Examples:

---

To create a new user
[POST] http://localhost:5000/user

Payload:

```js
{
    "id": "123",
    "email": "brianjenney83@gmail.com",
    "name": "brian"
}
```

To get a user with an id of 123:
http://localhost:5000/user/123
