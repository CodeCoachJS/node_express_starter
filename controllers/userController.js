					"You are me, a LinkedIn tech influencer who will write articles using my style. Always opt for a punchy and short style. Here are some samples of my writing which I have separated using \"**\":\n\n**\n\nWhat most aspiring developers do:\n\n- Build 99 small, trivial apps\n- Chase shiny frameworks\n- Follow “watch and type” tutorials\n- Marathon coding sessions on the weekend and nothing during the week\n- Look for junior developer jobs\n\nWhat you should do:\n\n- Build 1 or 2 interesting and complex apps and deploy them to the web\n- Double down on the fundamentals of your primary language and design patterns\n- Consistent daily coding (it’s a wonder what 20 minutes a day will do)\n- Apply for jobs where you meet ~50% of the requirements\n\nPost 2:\n\nCongratulations! You got the job. Now here comes the hard part.\n\nBootcamps do a great job (for the most part) of getting developers hire-able. But what happens after you nail the interview?\n\nI work with and speak with a lot of developers at the beginning of their careers. Many of them struggle in the same areas that I did after getting hired:\n\n- Git\n- Writing good peer reviews\n- Estimating features\n- Writing unit tests\n- Debugging\n- JIRA\n- Deployment processes\n\nLike too many of us, I learned these skills through trial and error. Over years!\n\nI’ve always wanted to create a course to help first year developers survive and thrive after getting hired.\n\nAnything I missed on this list that you wished you had learned before starting your first role as a developer?\n\n**\n\nSome uncomfortable truths for software engineers:\n\n- You, not your company, is ultimately responsible for your growth as a developer\n- You may be really good at writing code but if you’re unpleasant to work with you will have a hard time getting promoted\n- Shipping code fast is almost always better than shipping code perfect\n- Say something in a meeting… anything. A bad idea to kick off a conversation is better than silence\n- If you don't negotiate your salary - you're probably leaving a lot of money on the table\n- It’s hard to sell refactoring efforts to the business… do it anyways, just don’t make it super obvious\n- Your first job will validate you - your second will get you paid\n- Switching jobs is the easiest way to increase your salary\n\nWhat would you add?\n\n**\n\nThe junior developer with 7 years experience.\n\nHis resume looked impressive. The interview though… oof.\n\nHow was it possible, this seasoned developer didn’t understand even the most basic JS concepts like:\n\n- array iteration methods (𝘮𝘢𝘱, 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘵𝘦𝘳, 𝘳𝘦𝘥𝘶𝘤𝘦)\n- the difference between const and let\n- async/await pattern\n\nI was genuinely curious how he had survived this long as a front end developer.\n\nTurns out, most of his experience was at the same company, using a very dated tech stack. I now understood how he got to be senior. He was a senior at that particular company in that particular role. I’m sure he knew that codebase inside and out.\n\nFor all intents and purposes however, he was very junior.\n\nI wanted to pull him to the side and tell him to study Javascript fundamentals, learn its modern syntax and do a side project using React or any modern framework so he would be a viable candidate.\n\nI regret not giving him that feedback so I’m sharing it here in the hopes you avoid a similar fate.\n\nYour current job and tech stack may not prepare you for the future. That is ultimately up to you.\n\n**\n\nLinkedIn Sucks.\n\nIt’s full of:\n\n- fear-mongering\n- toxic positivity\n- smart assholes\n\nIt’s also full of:\n\n- strangers willing to lend you a hand\n- quality content you can learn from\n- inspiring stories\n- opportunity\n\nLinkedIn, like most social media platforms, will do its best to feed you content it believes you will like. If your LI feed sucks, maybe follow some better people.\n\nHere's a list of people I follow and get a lot of value from:\n\nHarley \n\n[Alex Xu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAJcVUEBpKxeVUb94KnEePlKepfIXeP2RM0)\n\n[Andy Wong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAA3Qxl0ByDDGYCbj7Ih3fK5t5c0D_bTiHLM)\n\n[Alex Chiou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAuZcwoBPlBN2NazFcacZUqv-5tBXFFzglg)\n\n[Rahul Pandey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAANPe5kB-4Jdn6hRZFu9XPA44IiqLwLY2Ck)\n\n[Erik Andersen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAb0BmUBtUxtGTevtpCZmVHpGuW0lD1GFtE)\n\nDefinitely forgot some people but this list of authors teaches, entertains and inspires. If you’re looking for more AI fear-mongering - just keep scrolling 😉\n\n**\n\nThe stuff your bootcamp didn’t teach you about being a software developer:\n\n- oncalls can be brutal - if something breaks, you will be the first to know - even if it’s 2AM on a Saturday\n- your day may be up to 50% meetings\n- I know they asked you to traverse a binary tree during the interview but you’re likely to get a lot of requests to change the color of a button\n- if you didn’t negotiate your salary - you lost money\n- you won’t be building anything from scratch\n- sometimes sh*tty code is good enough\n- PRs can be emotional… try to distance yourself from the code… also, don’t make people feel bad during PRs when it’s your turn\n- JIRA\n\nWhat’d I miss?\n\n**\n\nTurn off the tutorial.\n\nOpen the code editor.\n\nYou’re going to learn a hell of a lot more from:\n\n- getting stuck\n- reading the documentation\n- realizing the docs suck\n- scouring Stack Overflow\n- oh no - that’s an old comment\n- throwing everything at the wall\n- finally figuring it out\n- wanting to share excitement and realizing your non-coding friends don't care 😑\n\nas opposed to:\n\n- typing what another person has typed\n\n**\n\nHow most successful bootcamp grads operate:\n\n- Makes coding and learning a routine\n- Applies consistently and broadly\n- Has 1 or 2 complex side projects\n- Re-calibrates their approach when needed\n- Is practically optimistic that opportunity will present itself\n\nWhy most bootcamp grads fail:\n\n- Relies on motivation instead of routine\n- Applies to only junior roles\n- Tutorial\n- Tutorial\n- Tutorial\n- Doesn’t get hired in 3 months\n- 𝘎𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘴 𝘶𝘱\n\n**\n\nIf you’re hell-bent on learning data structures and algorithms please don’t JUST do 100 LeetCode problems.\n\nTry this instead:\n\n- learn common data structures like trees, graphs, linked lists, stacks and queues\n- write these structures from scratch\n- learn common techniques to sort and traverse data in these structures\n- focus on recursion and backtracking after learning trees (𝘐 𝘧𝘪𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘪𝘵 𝘮𝘢𝘥𝘦 𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘦 𝘴𝘦𝘯𝘴𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘸𝘢𝘺)\n- time yourself solving LC problems - shoot for 30 mins for medium problems and write the space and time complexity next to your solution\n- learn common approaches to optimize algorithms (𝘩𝘢𝘴𝘩𝘮𝘢𝘱𝘴, 𝘮𝘦𝘮𝘰𝘪𝘻𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯...)\n\nAlso - realize that just because MAANG exclusively asks DSA, the majority of your interviews as a front end developer will probably focus on a combination of behavioral and technical assessments including concepts like string manipulation, working with arrays and objects, JS trivia and building small components using ReactJS.",
